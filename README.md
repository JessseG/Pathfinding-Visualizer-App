# Pathfinding Visualizer built with React
This is a React application I put togetherfor visualizing search algorithms like
Dijkstraâ€™s, Depth-First and A-star search algorithms. Its very user-friendly and allows
one to see how the search algorithms expand throughout a grid to find the shortest
path between the start & an end point. By default the app loads the grid up with
random obstacles, but it includes additional features such as allowing users to draw
their own custom walls & obstacles with the cursor orload random ones using the
randomize button.
